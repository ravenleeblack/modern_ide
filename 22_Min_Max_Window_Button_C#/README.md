In this lesson, we will implement the click events needed to make the minimize and maximize buttons work. However, there's a small issue with the maximize button due to the absence of a header in the main window, which affects its functionality.

In our XAML code, we should add click events named `min_program` and `max_program` to the respective button tags at the end of the code:

```xml
<Button x:Name="main_header_min" Content="_" Grid.Column="19" Width="16" Height="16" Padding="0,-2,0,0" Background="#FF141414" Foreground="Teal" BorderBrush="{x:Null}" Click="min_program" />
<Button x:Name="main_header_max" Content="[]" Grid.Column="20" Width="16" Height="16" Padding="0,-2,0,0" Background="#FF141414" Foreground="Teal" BorderBrush="{x:Null}" Click="max_program" />
```

Once we have created these click events, similar to how we handled the exit button, we will define functions in the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file as follows:

```csharp
private void min_program(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Minimize the window
    WindowState = WindowState.Minimized;
}

private void max_program(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Toggle between maximizing and restoring the window
    if (WindowState == WindowState.Normal)
    {
        WindowState = WindowState.Maximized;
    }
    else
    {
        WindowState = WindowState.Normal;
    }
}
```

These functions will handle minimizing and toggling the window between maximized and normal states.
