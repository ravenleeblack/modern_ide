As we all know, making the ui and the event code related to make that ui work, for a real ide simply doesnt exist in the coding community. I mean there is just not enough information on how to build a usable one. Making anything ui isnt easy per say and we really need to up our game on ui tuterials.

I am not the best in C# or xaml so I am hoping others will help contribute to this project. I have been building my own language and a compiler for it in pure c and nasm, and I am almost finished with it, so I would love to have the ui or ide part of it ready for when I do.

I would also like this to be a place for others to start or refer to when trying to create and design thier own ide.
