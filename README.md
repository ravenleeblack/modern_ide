# Illeshian-Ide

The documentation to design a real ide seems to be non-existing. I hope over time members of the community will help contribute that wonderful knowledge.

There are usally 2 main parts to any front end program:   the UI elements and the mechanics behind the UI elements to make them work. 

In this project we will be using xaml for the ui elements and C# for the mechanics. I am not claiming to be good at either xaml or c# but I will try my best to start collecting the infomation needed to create a real ide. 

I really would like this to be a place for others to start or refer to, when trying to create and design, thier own ide. 

The way I have decided to approach this is in lessons that build up over time and maybe, just maybe, one day we will have a real something to look forward too. So I am hoping others will help contribute to this project.

I am a pure c and nasm kind of guy and I have been building my own language and the compiler for it over the last few years, and I am almost finished with it. So you can see why I would love to have the ui frontend ready for when I do finish the compiler. This of course has steered me into learning wpf xaml for the user interface so I hope someone finds this project interesting enough to help make this a thing.



The goals of this project:

- Edit files in a tabbed window
- Create new files in a tabbed window
- Open files into a tabbed window
- Save files from a tabbed window
- A plugin framework to make everything work properly like a real ide
- Dockable windows that can be redocked
- Syntax formatting for current languages
- Syntax formatting and options for new languages
- True theme setting for the user
- Get the run button connected to a couple of backends for testing (compiler/assembler)
- More like VS and less like sublime or atom
- A way to put sub folders on the command line and add to path of the button project path
- A way to add exectuables to the list in the project button   ( so you can pick your compiler/assembler then your project path before pressing play)

- debugger
- hex reader, converter, formatter
- binary reader, converter, formatter
