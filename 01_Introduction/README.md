In order to create this project we are going to take it step by step. With every new lesson we will add a new feature until we are finished and have our desired ide.

By now you should have a new project opened and a it should look something like this:

![opened_project](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Illeshian-Ide/assets/76606152/1f3efc7e-d439-4d49-8657-a8acec31fa70)

In our file solution we should have:

![file_solution](https://github.com/ravenleeblack/Illeshian-Ide/assets/76606152/bca19738-27fd-4c96-b6a7-fd7839a23db5)

In future lessons I will not be be adding the Properties or References files into each of the lessons. These are automatically added when the project is created. I will only be adding the newly updated files of app.config, app.xaml mainwindow.xaml or any new files that are created as we progress in order to keep the project as clean as possible.

So right now if you press play then you should already have a nice window that will display!! In the first tuterial we will maximize it and provide a color for the back ground.
