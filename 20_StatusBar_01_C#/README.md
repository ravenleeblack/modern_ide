In this lesson we are going to use C# to make our run button change the color of the status bar to an orange rgb and show the text ```Status: Running``` and then return back to normal when the stop has been pressed. This is something that visual studio does to let you know the compiler is running and its a very nice feature. Its easy to get side-tracked and it helps to have a color marker in the status bar indicating to you that its still running.
