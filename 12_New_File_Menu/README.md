Back in the lesson 09 We didnt really do anything except make a placeholder window for the text editor. This placeholder window was used to push the windows already in the DockPanel into the correct position they should be in. In this lesson we are gong to figure out how to out to create a new tabbed window to be used as a file. The issue here is that I know for the open and save options, windows already provides a window, that we can use to setup those options but I have not seen a window for new files. First we need a window we can hold all the ui controls in, then we need to make a ListBox that we can choose files from, we also need the option to name the file, and finally accept or decline any changes. We probably could judt create a custom made window but our xaml code is already starting to get pretty long so we are going to create a whole new window for the new file menu.
