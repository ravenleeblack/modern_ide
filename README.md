# Illeshian-Ide

The documentation to design a real ide seems to be non-existing. I hope over time members of the community will help contribute that wonderful knowledge.

There are usally 2 main parts to any front end program:   the UI elements and the mechanics behind the UI elements to make them work. 

In this project we will be using xaml for the ui elements and C# for the mechanics. I am not claiming to be good at either xaml or c# but I will try my best to start collecting the infomation needed to create a real ide. 

I really would like this to be a place for others to start or refer to, when trying to create and design, thier own ide. 

The way I have decided to approach this is in lessons that build up over time and maybe, just maybe, one day we will have a real something to look forward too. So I am hoping others will help contribute to this project.

I am a pure c and nasm kind of guy and I have been building my own language and a compiler for the language for the last few years, and I am almost finished with it, so I would love to have the frontend or ide part of it ready for when I do finish the compiler or backend. This has steered me into learning wpf xaml for frontends so I hope someone finds this interesting enough to help make this a thing.


If you want to help I am around my computer alot so I can return convos fairly quick. If you dont want to submit here then I welcome emails and even would to see anyone make a video.
