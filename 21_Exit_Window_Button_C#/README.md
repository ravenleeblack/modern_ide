In this lesson, we have finally added the much-needed click event for the exit button in our XAML. We've named the click event "exit_program" because it makes sense. Here's the improved code:

XAML in MainWindow.xaml:
```xml
<Button x:Name="main_header_exit" Content="X"  Grid.Column="21" Width="16" Height="16" Padding="0" Background="#FF141414" Foreground="Teal" BorderBrush="{x:Null}" Click="exit_program" />
```

In your MainWindow.xaml.cs file, you've added the "exit_program" function:

```csharp
private void exit_program(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Application.Current.Shutdown();
}
```

Now, if you compile the program, you can exit your main window by using the main menu's exit button. This straightforward implementation will effectively close the application when the exit button is clicked.

This is a clean and simple way to handle the exit functionality in your application, making it clear and intuitive for users to close the window.
