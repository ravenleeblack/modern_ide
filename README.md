# Illeshian-Ide - Building an IDE from Scratch

Creating a real Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a challenging task, and the documentation on how to go about it is near non-existing. I hope that, with time, members of the community will come together to contribute their valuable knowledge to this project.

Any frontend program typically consists of two primary components: the User Interface (UI) elements and the underlying mechanics that make those elements work seamlessly.

In this project, I am writing it in XAML for the UI elements and C# for the mechanics. While I can't claim expertise in either XAML or C#, I'm committed to gathering the information required to develop a full-fledged IDE. My vision for this project is for it to serve as a valuable resource for those embarking on their journey to create and design their own IDE.

My approach to this project is organized into lessons that will gradually build up over time. I'm optimistic that, with the help of others in the community, we can create something truly remarkable. It's a collaborative effort that I hope others will join.

As someone who has been deeply involved in C and NASM programming and has been working on a language and its compiler for several years, I am on the brink of completing this compiler. Consequently, I'm eager to have the UI frontend ready for when I finish the compiler. This has led me to delve into learning WPF XAML for the user interface. I hope that this project will pique the interest of others and encourage their participation in making it a reality.


Goals of this Project:

- Edit files within a tabbed window.
- Create new files within a tabbed window.
- Open files in a tabbed window.
- Save files from a tabbed window.
- Implement a plugin framework to ensure the proper functioning of the IDE.
- Allow for dockable windows that can be redocked as needed.
- Provide syntax formatting for existing programming languages.
- Offer syntax formatting options for new and custom languages.
- Allow users to choose and customize themes.
- Connect the "Run" button to multiple backends for testing, such as a compiler or assembler.
- Create an interface more similar to Visual Studio, prioritizing simplicity.
- Facilitate the inclusion of subfolders in the command line and add path selection to the project path button.
- Enable the addition of executables to the listbox in the project button for compiler and assembler selection before execution.

In addition to these features, we have ambitious plans for this project:
- Debugger
- Hex reader, converter, and formatter
- Binary reader, converter, and formatter
