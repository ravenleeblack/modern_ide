In this lesson we are gooing to make the UI element for the File Archive window. In order to do this we will use the TabControl tag and name it like we usally do.

```
<TabControl x:Name="archive_window">
</TabControl>
```

Seen we are starting to get familiar with the properties tab we need to go to layout, dock and set the tab windows dock to be right, next we change the background color to rgb 20, 20, 20 so that it matches with the rest of our ui. We can set our foreground color to white rgb 250, 250, 250 for later use. We can set or BorderBrush to be rgb 0, 0, 0 so that we have a nice dark border. Under layout we need to set the width to 290 and the height to 974.

If you have done everything properly your window should look like this:

Again its going to stay in the middle until we add another window. Once we add another window this window will move into place. As you can see from the image the StatusBar from our last lesson has moved down into the proper place as it should.
