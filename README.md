# Illeshian-Ide

Designing the UI for an ide and then coding the mechanics behind it, to make the ui work for a real ide seems to be non existing. There is just not enough information on how to build a usable ide. UI design for anything really isnt easy per say and we really need to up our game on UI tuterials.

I am not claiming to be good at xaml or c# at all but I will try my best to collect the information needed so that maybe in the future this repo could provide some useful information to anyone else looking to build an ide. I am not the best in xaml or C# so I am hoping others will help contribute to this project. I am a pure c and nasm kind of guy and I have been building my own language and a compiler for the language for the last few years, and I am almost finished with it, so I would love to have the frontend or ide part of it ready for when I do finish the compiler or backend. This has steered me into learning wpf xaml for frontends so I hope someone finds this interesting enough to help make this a thing. I really would like this to be a place for others to start or refer to, when trying to create and design, thier own ide.
